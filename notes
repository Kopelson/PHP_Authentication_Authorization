Authentication and Authorization

Goal: Know how to protect your PHP applications

Access Control List Key Advantages
    -Quickly audit user permissions
    -Know what users should not be able to do
    -Used for years in computer security
    -Used in the major operating systems
    -Used in network security

HTTP basic and digest Authentication

    What is authentication?

    The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system."

    There are multiple authentication types

    Single-factor
        a form
        biometric data
        additional item

    multi-factor
        a form + biometric or additional item or etc

    multiform decreases the oddsthat someone can logon as you


    Authentication Vs Authorization

    authentication is not authorization

    authentication determines if a user is valid
    authorization a user has already been verified.

    The benefits
    1. only valid users have access
    2. Access is appropriately authorized


    Common Authentication Types

    HTTP Authentication

    Authentication framework, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request, and by a client to provide authentication information, as defined by RFC 7235

    -doesnt use login pages
    uses http headers
    there are 6 types
        basic
        digest
        bearer

    Form-based Authentication

    -has no formal specification
    -uses http and html elements
    -is very flexible
    -can be very creative

    Form-based Authentication Flow

    form ---> server

    Please Be Aware set the HTTPonly and secure flags to avoid xss attacks

HTTP Digest Authentication
    - Replacement for Basic Authentication
